Perfect! We have a **clear MVP blueprint**, so we can start implementing it step by step. Here’s how I suggest we structure the development for your **Cientme gaming feature**:

---

### **1. Models**

**a) Game Model**

* Creator (ForeignKey → User)
* Title / Description / Image / Optional Link
* Reward Type (cash, digital, product)
* Number of Winners
* Reel (ForeignKey → Reel) if linked to a reel
* Status (Active / Completed)
* Created timestamp

**b) GameParticipant Model**

* User (ForeignKey → User)
* Game (ForeignKey → Game)
* Guess / Participation details
* Is\_winner (Boolean)

**c) RewardClaim Model**

* Game (ForeignKey → Game)
* Winner (ForeignKey → User)
* QR Code / Claim Info / Proof Image
* Status (Pending / Completed / Disputed)
* Created timestamp

**d) Optional Complaint Model**

* Game (ForeignKey → Game)
* Winner (ForeignKey → User)
* Message / Details
* Status (Pending / Reviewed / Resolved)

---

### **2. Views / APIs**

* **Game Creation** (creator/company)
* **List Active Games** (after reel ends)
* **Participate / Submit Guess**
* **Select Winners** (randomized)
* **Claim Reward** (send QR or info to creator)
* **Messaging** (winner → creator, one-to-one)
* **Complaint Submission**

---

### **3. Logic Flow**

1. Reel ends → check if reel has a linked game → show game UI.
2. User participates → system records participation.
3. Game ends → select winners randomly → show winners & reward info.
4. Winner messages creator → sends QR / claim info.
5. Optional proof → store in RewardClaim.
6. Complaint flow if reward not received → logged for admin review.
7. Creator accountability → temporary block if repeated failures.

---

### **4. Frontend Notes**

* Game should **pop up immediately after reel ends**.
* Reward info **display image, text, optional link** clearly.
* Messaging button visible **only for winners**.
* Complaint form accessible **after reward claim window**.

---

We can start coding **step 1: Models** first. I can write **the Django models for Game, GameParticipant, RewardClaim, and Complaint** following our MVP plan.

Do you want me to do that now?
