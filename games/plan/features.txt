Perfect! We have a **clear MVP blueprint**, so we can start implementing it step by step. Here’s how I suggest we structure the development for your **Cientme gaming feature**:

---

### **1. Models**

**a) Game Model**

* Creator (ForeignKey → User)
* Title / Description / Image / Optional Link
* Reward Type (cash, digital, product)
* Number of Winners
* Reel (ForeignKey → Reel) if linked to a reel
* Status (Active / Completed)
* Created timestamp

**b) GameParticipant Model**

* User (ForeignKey → User)
* Game (ForeignKey → Game)
* Guess / Participation details
* Is\_winner (Boolean)

**c) RewardClaim Model**

* Game (ForeignKey → Game)
* Winner (ForeignKey → User)
* QR Code / Claim Info / Proof Image
* Status (Pending / Completed / Disputed)
* Created timestamp

**d) Optional Complaint Model**

* Game (ForeignKey → Game)
* Winner (ForeignKey → User)
* Message / Details
* Status (Pending / Reviewed / Resolved)

---

### **2. Views / APIs**

* **Game Creation** (creator/company)
* **List Active Games** (after reel ends)
* **Participate / Submit Guess**
* **Select Winners** (randomized)
* **Claim Reward** (send QR or info to creator)
* **Messaging** (winner → creator, one-to-one)
* **Complaint Submission**

---

### **3. Logic Flow**

1. Reel ends → check if reel has a linked game → show game UI.
2. User participates → system records participation.
3. Game ends → select winners randomly → show winners & reward info.
4. Winner messages creator → sends QR / claim info.
5. Optional proof → store in RewardClaim.
6. Complaint flow if reward not received → logged for admin review.
7. Creator accountability → temporary block if repeated failures.

---

### **4. Frontend Notes**

* Game should **pop up immediately after reel ends**.
* Reward info **display image, text, optional link** clearly.
* Messaging button visible **only for winners**.
* Complaint form accessible **after reward claim window**.

---

We can start coding **step 1: Models** first. I can write **the Django models for Game, GameParticipant, RewardClaim, and Complaint** following our MVP plan.

Do you want me to do that now?






===================Topics of game==========================
###############Topics we already covered###################

Game model basics – fields like title, reward_type, number_of_winners, guess_min, guess_max, etc.

Fairness system – salt, hash_value, and winning_numbers_encrypted with Fernet.

Admin setup – Game, GameSubmission, WinningNumber, GameHistory, WinnerHistory.

Serializer setup – exposing the right fields, read-only for fairness values.

.env + FERNET_SECRET_KEY – secure storage, removed auto key generation.

Soft delete idea – is_active=False instead of permanent delete.




######################⏳ Topics still left#########################

Game Join/Participation – API for users to submit guesses.

Auto Close Game – mark game inactive after duration/end_time.

Winner Selection Logic – decrypt numbers, assign winners, store in WinningNumber + WinnerHistory.

Reward Claim Flow – winners claim their prize.

Game History Auto-Save – completed games go to history.

Public Verification Endpoint – users can verify salt + hash + decrypted numbers.

Leaderboard / Stats – player ranking.

Notifications System – when game ends or user wins.

Reward Types Logic – coins, vouchers, etc.

Fraud Prevention – prevent duplicate guesses, enforce min/max.







*************************************************************
⏳ Topics still left (not fully implemented yet)

Game Join/Participation – API exists partially via GameSubmissionSerializer, but we need:

Auto-check if the game is still active.

Prevent submissions after end_time.

Possibly return a meaningful response like “Game closed” if duration ended.

Auto Close Game – automatically mark game inactive after duration/end_time. (Currently, end_time is set, but no automated job to close.)

Winner Selection Logic – currently, we check only guessed numbers against unclaimed WinningNumbers.

We need a full automatic winner selection after game closes, decrypting numbers, assigning winners, and updating WinningNumber + WinnerHistory.

Reward Claim Flow – winners can claim prize. (Not implemented yet.)

Game History Auto-Save – completed games moving to GameHistory. (Currently, GameHistory exists but auto-save is not implemented.)

Public Verification Endpoint – verify salt + hash + decrypted numbers. (Not done yet.)

Leaderboard / Stats – player ranking. (Not done.)

Notifications System – notify users when game ends or they win. (Not done.)

Reward Types Logic – coins, vouchers, physical products. (Partially defined via reward_type, but logic to assign/apply rewards is pending.)
